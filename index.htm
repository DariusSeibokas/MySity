<p>The fifth largest city in Lithuania, the capital of Aukstaitija Ethnographic Region, the seventh  
Largest city in the Baltics and the greenest city of Lithuania. </p>
 <p><img src="images/savivaldybe.jpg" alt = "savivaldybe" width="400" height="200">Panevezys is situated halfway between two Baltic capitals- Vilnius (130 km) and Riga (150 km).</p>
<p>Panevezys has a favourable geographic position and good communication potentials.  VIA BALTICA  
Highway connects the city to Scandinavia and Western European countries.
</p>
<p>It occupies 50 square kilometres with more than 112 thousand inhabitants.
</p>
<p>Panevezys lies on the banks of the river Nevezis, the sixth longest river in Lithuania. The river  
gave it's name to the city itself. Senvage (the Old River Bed) is considered the symbol of Panevezys and  is a famous place for leisure time and festivals.
</p>
<p>Since long time ago Panevezys has been well known for its industrial production: cables, linen,  
decorative glass products, as well as international award winning Kalanapilis Beer. Panevezys is open  
for investments and welcomes the start and development of business. With this aim Panevezys City  
Municipality has begun implementation of the project PANEVEZYS INDUSTRIAL PARK which is partially  
financed by EU.
</p>
<p>Some people think of Panevezys as an industrial spot, some- as the city of Juozas Miltinis Drama  
Theatre, some - as the city of the world famous International Ceramic Symposia; others- as the capital  
of cycling and Ultra Triathlon.
</p>
<p> Every year the city and the residents celebrate the City Day. This day you can visit different  
historical periods, try old crafts, admire the views and become part of it.
</p>
<p> The best way of getting to know Panevezys is to visit it. You are most welcome to a green, compact  
and cosy city in every time of a year !
