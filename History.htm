The Grand Duke of Lithuania and the King of Poland Alexander laid down the foundation stone in the history of Panevezys that celebrated its 500th anniversary in 2003.
 
On September 7th, 1503 the Grand Duke donated the land between the rivers Levuo and Nevezis on the condition that a church was built.
 
The old church has not survived and its descendant St. Peter and Paul's Church has changed its place and has been rebuilt for several times.
 
Each age has left emphatic and unique traces in the chronicle of the city.
 
In the XVI th century Panevezys was famous for agriculture, crafts and pubs. By the old Panevezys, on the left bank of the river Nevezis the new Panevezys appeared. It soon outdid the Old Town.
 
The brick building- the Archives of the Court was built in Panevezys in the XVII-XVIII th century. The oldest building of the city remained.
 
In the XVIII th century the Pior Monks opened the first secondary school in the city.
 
In the XIXth century the city expanded 16 times. The change of industry, the growth of trade and the development of education system were obvious.
 
In the beginning of the XIXth century Panevezys became a strong regional economical and cultural centre. These positions remain until now.
